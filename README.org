A memento mori with emojis

100 Blocks a Day
idea stolen from: http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/10/100-blocks-day.html

Most people sleep about seven or eight hours a night.
That leaves 16 or 17 hours awake each day. Or about 1,000 minutes.

Let’s think about those 1,000 minutes as 100 10-minute blocks.
That’s what you wake up with every day.

(assumption: time awake = 7-23 o'clock)
