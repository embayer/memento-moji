#+TITLE: memento-moji  💀 ⌛️

A memento mori with emojis in the shell 🤔

100 Blocks a Day
idea stolen from: http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/10/100-blocks-day.html

Most people sleep about seven or eight hours a night.
That leaves 16 or 17 hours awake each day. Or about 1,000 minutes.

Let’s think about those 1,000 minutes as 100 10-minute blocks.
That’s what you wake up with every day.

(assumption: time awake = 7-23 o'clock)

* usage:
#+begin_src sh
./memento_moji.py         # emoji flavor
./memento_moji.py block   # block flavor
./memento_moji.py circle  # circle flavor
#+end_src
